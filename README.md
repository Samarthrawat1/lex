Hello Everyone. I am starting an open source logs exposition service. 
This will mainly be for beginner to medium apps hosted on the cloud. 

I do not wish for a lot of complex functionality. 
Right now, I only want to create a dashboard where you can see and filter logs. 
Also, I aim for the installation to be as simple as possible. Perhaps scripts, or docker images, or both. Lets see. 
I will start from VM and then kubernetes and other services. 

Users can enter subpath, subdomain. If users cannot get one, I can create a micrologic to provide domain. 

I was thinking python might be good enough for this. basic html/css should suffice for the dashboard I guess? lets see.
Contributions are more than appreciated. xD
